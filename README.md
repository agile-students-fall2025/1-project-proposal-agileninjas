## Description (From an End-User Perspective)  
**InstaSkill** is a mobile-friendly web application where users can teach what they know and learn what they don’t by exchanging skills directly with one another.  

The platform removes the barrier of money – instead, knowledge and time are the “currency.”  

### Key Features for Users  
- **Create a profile** listing both skills offered and skills wanted.  
- **Browse and search** for potential matches.  
- **Directly message and schedule time** with other users.  
- **Leave reviews and ratings** after meetings.  
- **Track completed swaps and progress** through a personal dashboard.

## For Whom  
This platform is fit for anyone willing to learn, share, and grow by exchanging skills with others.  

Examples:  
- Students trading tutoring help.  
- Freelancers swapping technical or creative services.  
- Hobbyists teaching each other things like cooking, music, or photography.  

The system works for anyone who values **collaboration over cost**.

## Scope  
**InstaSkill** is ambitious enough to challenge the team but not so large that it’s unmanageable within one semester.  

### Expected Deliverables  
- Matching algorithm (skills offered vs. wanted).  
- Secure user authentication.  
- CRUD operations for skills, sessions, and reviews.  
- Database schema supporting many-to-many relationships (users ↔ skills).  
- Clean, mobile-first UX design (React).  
- Unit testing for matching logic and CRUD operations.  

The current focus: **scheduling + matching + reviews** - building a working application that satisfies the core use case.  

---

## Stretch Goals (if time permits)  
- **Gamification**: XP points, levels, or badges for teaching/learning streaks.  
- **Group Swaps**: Small group sessions (e.g., *“Intro to Python for 3 learners”*).  
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages.  
- **Integration**: Video calling API for online lessons on-platform.  

---

## Why InstaSkill?  
- **Relatability**: Everyone has skills they can teach and things they want to learn.  
- **Scalability**: Start simple, expand later, accommodate any number of users.  
- **Complexity**: Showcases authentication, database relations, matching logic, CRUD, UX, testing, and deployment.
